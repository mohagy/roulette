# Complete Database Migration to Firebase

## Overview
This guide will help you migrate your entire MySQL database to Firebase Realtime Database and configure your app to use Firebase as the primary database.

## Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Open in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/slipp/migrate_complete_database.html
   ```

2. Click "🚀 Start Complete Migration"

3. Wait for the migration to complete (may take a few minutes)

4. Check the results - you should see:
   - ✅ All draws migrated
   - ✅ Game state migrated
   - ✅ Analytics migrated
   - ✅ Betting slips migrated
   - ✅ Bets migrated

## Step 2: Verify Data in Firebase

1. Go to Firebase Console:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/roulette-2f902/database

2. Make sure you're in **Realtime Database** (not Firestore)

3. You should see:
   - `gameState/current` - Current game state with roll history
   - `draws/` - All draw results (143+ draws)
   - `analytics/current` - Analytics data
   - `bettingSlips/` - All betting slips
   - `bets/` - All bets
   - `gameState/drawInfo` - Current/next draw numbers

## Step 3: Your App Now Uses Firebase

After migration:
- ✅ All new data goes to Firebase
- ✅ `index.php` reads from Firebase
- ✅ `tvdisplay` reads from Firebase
- ✅ Real-time sync works automatically

## What Gets Migrated

1. **roulette_state** → `gameState/current`
   - Current draw number
   - Next draw number
   - Roll history (last 5)
   - Winning numbers

2. **detailed_draw_results** → `draws/{drawNumber}`
   - All 143+ draws
   - Winning numbers
   - Colors
   - Timestamps

3. **roulette_analytics** → `analytics/current`
   - All spins history
   - Number frequency
   - Current draw number

4. **betting_slips** → `bettingSlips/{slipId}`
   - All betting slips
   - Stake amounts
   - Payout amounts

5. **bets** → `bets/{betId}`
   - All individual bets
   - Bet types
   - Amounts

## After Migration

Your app will:
- ✅ Read from Firebase (not MySQL)
- ✅ Write to Firebase (not MySQL)
- ✅ Work in real-time across all devices
- ✅ Continue working even if MySQL is down

## Troubleshooting

If migration fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify MySQL database is accessible
3. Check Firebase security rules allow writes
4. Try running migration again

If data is missing:
1. Check Firebase console to see what was migrated
2. Run migration again (it will overwrite existing data)
3. Check migration results for error messages
